# Food Security Dashboard

This project is a **Food Security Dashboard** built with **React**, **Vite**, and **TypeScript**. It visualizes food security data for African countries, including **Food Consumption Scores (FCS)**, **Reduced Coping Strategy Index (RCSI)**, and crisis phases. Users can interact with a map to view statistics like the percentage of people in **Crisis (Phase 3)** to **Famine (Phase 5)**, along with data about **market** and **health access**.
